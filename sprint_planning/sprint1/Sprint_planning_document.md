Story (Role, Goal, Benefit)
    As a Trailhead staff member, I need members to have unique logins to the check-in system so that I have the data I need to customize their experience with Trailhead.

Roles for this Sprint - 

    Fitri   - Developer

    Rob     - Product owner

    Spencer - Scrum master

    Tucker  - Developer


Tasks - 

    Fitri (5 points) - 
        I will create a mock-up of the login page.

    Rob (5 points) - 
        I will contact Trailhead sponsor and setup a deployment server.

    Tucker (5 points) - 
        I will setup a development server and assist Spencer with researching web development
        frameworks.

    Spencer (4 points) - 
        I will research web development frameworks.


Acceptance Criteria - 

    [ ] Given I want to offer perks to certain members when I select criteria for filtering members,        then the members that I am looking for are returned

    [ ] Given a non-member is inside Trailhead, when they log into the WiFi, then there should be a         prompt to ask for a login or registration as guests.

    [ ] Given user information is being stored, when the system is breached, then user data is
        stored in a safe way.

    [ ] Given multiple users may be using multiple devices, when I want to track a user's usage, then       the data will follow the user and not just their devices.


Stretch Goals - 

    Stretch goals to be assigned below:

    Fitri - I will code initial UI (3 points).

    Rob - I will develop the DB schema (6 points).

    Spencer - I will write some queries for testing (2 points).
