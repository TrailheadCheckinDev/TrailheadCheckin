    Spencer - Scrum master

    Tucker  - Developer

Tasks -

        pushes to the master branch will push to Heroku.
        
    Rob (6 points) - 
        I will learn how to create a Docker container and deploy one to

        add members in bulk.  I will generate a new view for the admin panel.

        I will update the users table to add a 'last login' field. I will 
        work with Tucker to add an option to upload an excel file to add 
        members in bulk.

Acceptance Criteria - 

    [ ] Given I am logged into the admin panel when I want to see "who's logged in?"
        I see a list of currently logged in members.

    [ ] Given I am logged into the admin panel, when I want to upload an 
        excel file to add many users at once, that functionality is available.

    [ ] Given I am on the "checkin" page, when I enter the admin credentials, 
        an admin-specific page is loaded.
